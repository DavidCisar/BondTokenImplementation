Bond Token Issuance with ERC-1155 Smart Contracts

This project is derived from my master thesis, in which I designed and programmed an Ethereum-based bond token prototype.
As this code represents the bond token prototype I build during my masters thesis, the codebase should stay the same.

Instead, the project will be developed further in a different repository!
